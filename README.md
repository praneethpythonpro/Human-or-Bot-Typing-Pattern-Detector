# Human-or-Bot-Typing-Pattern-Detector
This project checks if the user is human or a bot by measuring typing speed and rhythm. The user types a given sentence, and the program records the time taken for each character. Based on accuracy and speed patterns, it predicts whether the typing is natural (human) or unusually fast (bot).
